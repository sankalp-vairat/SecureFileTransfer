# SecureFileTransfer
This project simulates the Secure File Transfer Framework.

In this project we are using the user client (clients used by users), one authentication server, one certifying authority.

Certifying authority has its own databse where the registered user's
information is stored in database.

Sequnce diagram provides an overview of the working of project.

Secure transfer has been achieved using the uses of encryption algorithms (AES, RSA) and CRC.
