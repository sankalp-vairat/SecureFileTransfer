# SecureFileTransfer
This project simulates the Secure File Transfer Framework.

In this project we are using the client (clients used by users), one authentication server, one certifying authority.

Certifying authority has its own database where the registered user's
information is stored in database.

Sequence diagram provides an overview of the working of project.

Secure transfer has been achieved using the uses of encryption algorithms (AES, RSA) and CRC.
# Refer sequence diagram for more details.
